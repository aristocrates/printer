To do:
------
 * Add exception handling for connection issues, and output message for when
 the printer is down telling IMSS to reboot it
 * (not related to the code but related to the printer administration) set
 an administrator password on the printer so random people can't mess with
 the settings (since the printer is accessible from the entire internet)
 * (also printer administration) when letsencrypt is working, we should use
 an ssl certificate from them rather than the current garbage self signed
 certificate
